---

## Step 4: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example file
copy .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your favorite text editor
notepad .env
```

**Minimal configuration** (paste your keys):

```bash
# Database (Docker will handle this)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://crypto_user:crypto_pass@localhost:5432/crypto_ai
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Your API Keys
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=crypto-trader:v1.0.0:by /u/your_username
CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Optional but recommended
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Keep defaults for everything else
```

---

## Step 5: Start Infrastructure

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis with Docker
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Wait 10 seconds for databases to initialize
timeout /t 10

# Check if containers are running
docker ps
```

You should see:
- `crypto-postgres` (running)
- `crypto-redis` (running)

---

## Step 6: Initialize Database

```bash
npm run migrate
```

**Expected output**:
```
‚úì Running migration: 001_initial_schema.sql
‚úì All migrations completed
```

---

## Step 7: Start the Application

**Option A: With Job Scheduler (Recommended)**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Start the web server on port 3000
- Start automated data collection
- Generate AI recommendations every 4 hours
- Create daily reports

**Option B: Manual Mode (Testing)**

```bash
# Disable scheduler in .env
ENABLE_JOB_SCHEDULER=false

# Then start
npm run dev
```

Use this for testing or if you want to run analysis manually.

---

## Step 8: Verify It's Working

### Check the Dashboard

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

You should see:
- Portfolio overview (starting at $10,000)
- Performance metrics
- Empty holdings (you haven't traded yet)

### Check the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Portfolio status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/portfolio
```

### Check Logs

```powershell
# View live logs
Get-Content logs\combined.log -Wait -Tail 20
```

Look for:
- ‚úì Database connected
- ‚úì Redis initialized
- ‚úì Job scheduler initialized
- üöÄ Server running on port 3000

---

## Step 9: Generate Your First Analysis

### Manual Analysis (Immediate)

```bash
# Analyze Bitcoin
npm run analyze BTC

# Analyze Ethereum
npm run analyze ETH

# Analyze all supported coins
npm run analyze ALL
```

This will:
1. Fetch current price
2. Get technical indicators
3. Analyze sentiment
4. Check market context
5. Generate AI recommendation

**Expected output**:
```
=== AI RECOMMENDATION ===
Action: BUY
Confidence: 72%
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Entry Price: $45,123.45
Stop Loss: $43,500.00
...
```

### Automated Analysis (Every 4 hours)

If you enabled the job scheduler, analysis runs automatically. Check logs:

```powershell
Get-Content logs\combined.log -Wait | Select-String "recommendation"
```

---

## Step 10: Execute Your First Trade

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/trades ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"symbol\": \"BTC\", \"side\": \"BUY\", \"quantity\": 0.01, \"stopLoss\": 43000, \"reasoning\": \"Testing system\"}"
```

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Wait for recommendations to appear
3. Click "Execute Trade" (if implemented)
4. Or use the API endpoint above

### Verify Trade

```bash
# Check recent trades
curl http://localhost:3000/api/trades

# Check portfolio
curl http://localhost:3000/api/portfolio
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Tips

### Adjust Job Frequency

Edit `.env` to change how often jobs run:

```bash
# More frequent (higher costs)
CRON_COLLECT_PRICES=*/1 * * * *      # Every minute
CRON_RECOMMENDATIONS=0 */2 * * *     # Every 2 hours

# Less frequent (lower costs)
CRON_COLLECT_PRICES=*/10 * * * *     # Every 10 minutes
CRON_RECOMMENDATIONS=0 */6 * * *     # Every 6 hours
```

### Adjust Risk Parameters

```bash
# More conservative
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=0.03               # 3% max per position
MAX_DAILY_LOSS=0.02                  # 2% daily loss limit

# More aggressive (not recommended)
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=0.10               # 10% max per position
MAX_DAILY_LOSS=0.05                  # 5% daily loss limit
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: These limits exist for safety. Don't increase them unless you understand the risks.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Database connection failed"

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | findstr postgres

# Restart PostgreSQL
docker-compose restart postgres

# Check logs
docker logs crypto-postgres
```

### "Redis connection failed"

```bash
# Check if Redis is running
docker ps | findstr redis

# Restart Redis
docker-compose restart redis
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"

You're hitting API limits. Solutions:
1. Reduce job frequency in `.env`
2. Wait for rate limit to reset (usually 1 minute)
3. Check cache is working (should prevent most hits)

### "Insufficient funds"

You're trying to trade more than your portfolio allows:
1. Check portfolio: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/portfolio`
2. Reduce trade quantity
3. Close some positions first

### "API key invalid"

Double-check your API keys in `.env`:
1. No extra spaces
2. No quotes around keys
3. Keys are active (not revoked)
4. For Reddit: Make sure user agent matches format

## üîí Important Reminders

### This is Paper Trading
- **NO REAL MONEY** is at risk
- Virtual $10,000 portfolio
- All trades are simulated
- Perfect for learning and testing

### AI is Not Perfect
- Expected win rate: 50-60% at best
- Many predictions will be wrong
- Past performance ‚â† future results
- Use as learning tool, not financial advice

### Never Use With Real Money
- Even after successful paper trading
- Market conditions change constantly
- Professional traders have huge advantages
- This is an educational project only
