# Exit Strategies Guide

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** Full Exit & Ladder Exit implemented

---

## üéØ Overview

Exit strategies determine how your positions are closed when protection levels (stop loss or take profit) are triggered. The right strategy depends on your trading style, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

---

## ‚úÖ Currently Implemented Strategies

### 1. Full Exit (Default)
**What:** Sells 100% of position when take profit level is reached.

**Example:**
```
Position: 2.0 ETH bought @ $2,000
Take Profit: $2,200
When price hits $2,200 ‚Üí Sell all 2.0 ETH

Result: Complete exit, full profit locked in
```

**Best For:**
- ‚úÖ Conservative traders
- ‚úÖ Clear profit targets
- ‚úÖ Risk-averse approach
- ‚úÖ Simplicity and predictability

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand and track
- Locks in all profits immediately
- Clear exit, no lingering exposure
- Best for lower confidence trades

**Cons:**
- Misses potential further upside
- All-or-nothing approach
- May cause FOMO if rally continues

**When to Use:**
- You have a specific profit target in mind
- You want to eliminate all risk once target is hit
- Market conditions are uncertain
- This is your first time using auto-trading

---

### 2. Ladder Exit
**What:** Sells position in increments, allowing you to capture profits while maintaining exposure.

**Example:**
```
Position: 2.0 ETH bought @ $2,000
Take Profit: $2,200

Execution:
1st trigger: Price $2,200 ‚Üí Sell 1.0 ETH (50%)
2nd trigger: Price $2,200 ‚Üí Sell 0.5 ETH (50% of remaining)
3rd trigger: Price $2,200 ‚Üí Sell 0.25 ETH (50% of remaining)
4th trigger: Price $2,200 ‚Üí Sell 0.125 ETH (50% of remaining)
...and so on

Result: Gradual exit as price holds or rises
```

**Best For:**
- ‚úÖ Strong trends
- ‚úÖ High conviction trades
- ‚úÖ Letting winners run
- ‚úÖ Reducing FOMO

**Pros:**
- Captures profits while keeping exposure
- Benefits from continued price appreciation
- Reduces regret if rally continues
- Psychologically easier (not an "all or nothing" decision)

**Cons:**
- More complex to track
- Remaining position exposed if price reverses
- Multiple transactions (more fees)
- Can result in small leftover positions

**When to Use:**
- You're in a strong uptrend
- High confidence in continued momentum
- Want to let winners run
- Comfortable with partial exposure

**How It Works:**
Each time the take profit level is hit, the system sells 50% of the **remaining** position. This creates a logarithmic scale-out pattern:
- Hit 1: Sell 50% of total
- Hit 2: Sell 50% of what's left (25% of original)
- Hit 3: Sell 50% of what's left (12.5% of original)
- And so on...

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Start Conservative

- **Trending Market:** Ladder Exit
- **Range-Bound Market:** Full Exit
- **Volatile Market:** Full Exit

### 3. Consider Your Goals
- **Capital Preservation:** Full Exit
- **Maximum Growth:** Ladder Exit
- **Balanced Approach:** Full Exit with higher take profit

### 4. Review and Adjust
- Check your trade history regularly
- Analyze which strategy performed better
- Adjust based on your results

### 5. Set Appropriate Levels

- **Ladder Exit:** Set wider take profit (10-20%)

---

## üìà Performance Tracking

Track these metrics to evaluate your strategy:

### For Full Exit:
- Average profit per trade
- Win rate
- Missed opportunity cost (compare to if you held)

### For Ladder Exit:
- Total profit captured across multiple exits
- Average number of exit levels hit
- Remaining position size at final exit

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Stop Loss Behavior:
**Both strategies sell 100% on stop loss trigger.** There's no laddering on downside protection - risk management always takes priority.

### Fee Considerations:
Ladder Exit will incur multiple transaction fees. Factor this into your profit calculations.

### Position Size Management:
Ladder Exit can leave very small positions (< $10). Consider setting a minimum exit size in future versions.

### Market Hours:
Position monitoring runs every 5 minutes. Your exact exit price may vary slightly from your take profit level.
