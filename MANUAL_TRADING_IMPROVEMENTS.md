## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive warning system for manual trades that provides user control while maintaining safety through informed consent.

---

## 🎯 Key Changes

### **1. Tiered Risk Management**

#### **Automated Trades** (Strict Rules)
- ❌ **Hard Blocks** - Trades are rejected if they violate rules
- **Position Size**: Max 5% of portfolio
- **Stop-Loss**: Mandatory
- **Stop-Loss Width**: Max 10% below entry
- **Max Positions**: 5 concurrent positions
- **Daily Loss Limit**: 5% per day (halts trading)
- **Trade Interval**: Minimum cooldown between trades

#### **Manual Trades** (Warnings + Confirmation)
- ⚠️ **Warnings** - User is informed but can proceed
- **Position Size**: Max 20% of portfolio (relaxed)
- **Stop-Loss**: Optional (warns if missing)
- **Stop-Loss Width**: No limit (warns if > 10%)
- **Max Positions**: 5 (warns if exceeded)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: Warns but allows trading
- **Trade Interval**: Informational only

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend Changes**

#### **1. Risk Management Interface (`riskManagement.ts`)**
```typescript
export interface RiskCheck {
  allowed: boolean;
  reason: string;
  currentRisk?: number;
  maxRisk?: number;
  warnings?: string[];  // NEW: For manual trade warnings
}
```

#### **2. Updated validateTrade() Function**
- Added `isManualTrade` parameter (default: false)
- Collects warnings instead of blocking for manual trades
- Returns warnings array when trade is allowed with concerns
- Provides human-readable warning messages:
  - "No stop-loss set. Your position is not protected from significant losses."
  - "Stop-loss is 15.0% below entry. This exceeds recommended 10% limit."
  - "Daily loss limit of 5.0% has been reached (current: 3.0%). Additional trading may increase losses."
  - "You already have 5 open positions. Maximum recommended is 5."

#### **3. API Endpoint (`/api/trade`)**
- Accepts `confirmWarnings` flag in request body
- Returns warnings on first call if present
- Requires confirmation before executing risky trades
- Provides structured error responses:
  ```json
  {
    "requiresConfirmation": true,
    "warnings": ["Warning 1", "Warning 2"],
    "message": "This trade has risk warnings. Please review and confirm."
  }
  ```

---

### **Frontend Changes**

#### **1. Warning Confirmation Dialog**
Shows user-friendly warnings with numbered list:
```
⚠️ RISK WARNINGS

1. Daily loss limit of 5.0% has been reached (current: 3.0%). 
   Additional trading may increase losses.

2. No stop-loss set. Your position is not protected from 
   significant losses.

These conditions exceed automated trading guidelines.

Would you like to proceed with this trade anyway?
```

#### **2. Two-Step Execution**
1. **First Call**: Check for warnings → Show confirmation if needed
2. **Second Call**: Execute with `confirmWarnings: true` if user confirms

#### **3. User-Friendly Error Messages**
- ✅ No more raw JSON errors
- ✅ Structured error objects with `message` field
- ✅ Consistent error formatting across all functions
- ✅ Clear, actionable error messages

## 🎨 UX Improvements

### **Error Display Consistency**

All error messages now follow this format:
- **Clear Title**: "Trade Execution Failed"
- **User-Friendly Message**: Extracted from `error.message` or `result.message`
- **Visual Indicators**: ❌ for errors, ⚠️ for warnings
- **Actionable Buttons**: "Back to Preview" or "Try Again"

### **No More JSON in UI**

**Eliminated:**
- Raw JSON response dumps
- `response.text()` being displayed directly
- Technical error codes in user messages

**Replaced With:**
- Parsed error messages
- Human-readable descriptions
- Clear next steps

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### **Warning System Tests**

- [ ] **Daily Loss Limit**: Trigger 5% daily loss, attempt manual trade
  - Should show warning, allow if confirmed
- [ ] **Wide Stop-Loss**: Set stop-loss 20% below entry
  - Should warn but allow
- [ ] **No Stop-Loss**: Attempt trade without stop-loss
  - Should warn but allow
- [ ] **Max Positions**: Open 5 positions, try to open 6th
  - Should warn but allow
- [ ] **Multiple Warnings**: Trigger multiple warning conditions
  - Should list all warnings, require single confirmation

### **Error Display Tests**

- [ ] **Invalid Symbol**: Try to trade non-existent coin
  - Should show clean error message
- [ ] **Network Error**: Disconnect and attempt trade
  - Should show user-friendly network error
- [ ] **Insufficient Funds**: Trade amount > balance
  - Should show clear balance error
- [ ] **API Error**: Simulate 500 error from backend
  - Should show graceful error message

### **Sell Function Tests**

- [ ] **Normal Sell**: Sell existing position
  - Should complete without warnings

## 🔒 Safety Guarantees

Even with relaxed rules, users are still protected:

1. **Maximum Position Size**: 20% (prevents all-in bets)
2. **Informed Decisions**: Clear warnings before risky actions
3. **Audit Trail**: All warnings logged with trade execution
4. **Automated Trading Unaffected**: Strict rules still apply to AI trades
