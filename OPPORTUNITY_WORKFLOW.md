# üéØ Intelligent Opportunity-Based Trading Workflow

## Overview

The new trading workflow implements a **smart discovery ‚Üí filter ‚Üí AI analysis** pipeline that eliminates useless "HOLD" recommendations and focuses only on **actionable BUY and SELL opportunities**.

---

## üîÑ Workflow Steps

### **1. Discovery Search (Scheduled)**
**Runs:** Every 4 hours (configurable via `CRON_RECOMMENDATIONS`)

- Fetches top coins based on user's `coinUniverse` setting (Top 10/25/50/100)
- Applies local filters based on `discoveryStrategy` (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
- Calculates composite scores from:
  - Volume score (unusual trading volume)
  - Momentum score (recent price movement)
  - Sentiment score (news & social media)

**Output:** Filtered list of candidates with scores stored in `discovered_coins` table

---

### **2. Opportunity Identification (Pre-AI Filter)**

#### **Buy Opportunities:**
- **Criteria:** Coins from discovery list **NOT** in portfolio
- **Reasons tracked:**
  - `breakout`: High momentum + high volume
  - `dip`: Recent pullback with good fundamentals
  - `discovery`: Strong composite score
- **Urgency levels:** High / Medium / Low

#### **Sell Opportunities:**
- **Criteria:** Coins **IN** portfolio meeting exit signals
- **Reasons tracked:**
  - `profit_target`: Gain > 25% (consider taking profits)
  - `risk_management`: Loss > 10% (prevent further loss)
  - `resistance`: Moderate profit at resistance level
- **Includes:** Current price, entry price, P&L, % gain

---

### **3. AI Analysis (Top Candidates Only)**

**Efficient API Usage:**
- Only analyzes top 3 buy + top 3 sell opportunities (configurable)
- Skips lower-priority opportunities (saved API costs)
- Requests AI to evaluate specific action (BUY or SELL)

**AI filters out non-actionable:**
- If AI recommends "HOLD" ‚Üí Not stored
- If AI confirms BUY ‚Üí Stored as buy recommendation
- If AI confirms SELL ‚Üí Stored as sell recommendation

---

### **4. Actionable Recommendations**

**Stored in `recommendations` table:**
- Action: "BUY" or "SELL" only (no HOLD)
- Confidence: AI confidence level (0-100%)
- Entry price, stop loss, take profit levels
- Position sizing suggestion
- Risk level assessment
- Reasoning and key factors

**Expires:** After 24 hours (recommendations are time-sensitive)

## üìä Benefits Over Old System

| Old System | New System |
|------------|------------|
| Analyzed ALL symbols randomly | Analyzes only promising opportunities |
| Many "HOLD" recommendations | Only BUY/SELL recommendations |
| No pre-filtering | Local filters before AI |
| High API costs | 60-90% lower API usage |
| No portfolio context | Separate buy/sell logic |
| Generic analysis | Targeted opportunity analysis |

## üîå API Endpoints

### **GET /api/opportunities**
Find current buy and sell opportunities (pre-AI filter)

**Query params:**
- `forceRefresh=true`: Run fresh discovery scan

**Response:**
```json
{
  "buyOpportunities": [
    {
      "symbol": "ETH",
      "name": "Ethereum",
      "reason": "breakout",
      "urgency": "high",
      "localScore": 78,
      "candidate": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "sellOpportunities": [
    {
      "symbol": "BTC",
      "reason": "profit_target",
      "urgency": "medium",
      "percentGain": 32.5,
      ...
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T22:48:00Z"
}
```

---

### **POST /api/recommendations/generate**
Generate AI recommendations for top opportunities

**Body:**
```json
{
  "maxBuy": 3,
  "maxSell": 3
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Generated 2 BUY and 1 SELL recommendations",
  "buyRecommendations": [ ... ],
  "sellRecommendations": [ ... ],
  "skipped": {
    "buy": 5,
    "sell": 2
  }
}
```

---

### **GET /api/recommendations**
Get current actionable recommendations (updated to filter HOLD)

**Query params:**
- `limit=10`: Max recommendations to return

**Response:** Array of BUY/SELL recommendations only

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **User Settings** (via Settings Modal)
- **Coin Universe:** Top 10/25/50/100 - Determines discovery scope
- **Discovery Strategy:** Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive - Affects filters and weights
- **Analysis Frequency:** How often discovery runs (1/4/8/24 hours)

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Recommendation schedule (default: every 4 hours)
CRON_RECOMMENDATIONS="0 */4 * * *"
```

---

## üß™ Manual Testing

### **1. Find Opportunities Manually:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/opportunities
```

### **2. Generate AI Recommendations:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/opportunities/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"maxBuy": 3, "maxSell": 3}'
```

### **3. View Recommendations:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/recommendations
```

## üìà Expected Behavior

### **When Discovery Runs:**
1. ‚úÖ Fetches top N coins by market cap
2. ‚úÖ Applies local filters (free, fast)
3. ‚úÖ Calculates scores and stores top candidates
4. ‚úÖ Identifies buy opportunities (not in portfolio)
5. ‚úÖ Identifies sell opportunities (in portfolio)
6. ‚úÖ Sends top 3+3 to AI for confirmation
7. ‚úÖ Stores only BUY/SELL recommendations
8. ‚ùå No HOLD recommendations stored

### **UI Display:**
- **Recent Recommendations:** Shows only BUY/SELL (no HOLD)
- **Action Buttons:** Quick execute or detailed analysis
- **Urgency Indicators:** High/Medium/Low priority
- **Discovery Score:** Pre-AI composite score
- **AI Confidence:** Post-AI confirmation level
